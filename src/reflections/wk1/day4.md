What is the purpose of wire-framing?

Wireframing helps you uhderstand the layout and functionality of your webpage. You can also use it to map out your content stratagey (information architecture) of multiple pages and influence users behavior. 

What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

They can be as simple as a crude pencil drawing to as complex one created with adobe xd with functioning buttons that will move you from page to page to test experience.


Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Yes. Life is about structure. If you don't know where your going your probably not going to get where you want to be. Same with a website. Understanding what is on each page and the purpose will affect what is on the page and what the user will do.
