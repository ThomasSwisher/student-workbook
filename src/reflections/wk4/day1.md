# Read Asynchronous Code > Callback Hell and answer the following questions
1. What are some of the signs and causes of Callback Hell?

Callback hell is caused when people try to write Javascript in a way where execution happens vissually from top to bottm. Signs would be code that forms a pyramid and all ends with a }).

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

Async basically means it will happen maybe not right now but in the future. Callbacks are just the name of a convention for using JavaScript functions. Instead of immediately giving a result it lets you know hey its coming.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix Callback Hell

Keep code shallow. This also helps make it more readable.
Modularize. Write small modules that do one thing. 
Handle every single error.
