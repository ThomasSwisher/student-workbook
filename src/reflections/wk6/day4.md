# Read Frontend Frameworks with Vue3 > Using Nested Routes in Vue.js and answer the following questions
1. What is a nested route?

As our apps get more complex it allows us to nest components inside others.

2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

An example might be on a recipe blog. Say you are reading about recipes based on origins you might find nested routes leading to other pages based on ethnicity.


3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

You can pass paramaters. One example would be when you need to access a specific image or user data.
